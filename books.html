<br />
<p1> This series by far has to be one of most favorite series I ever read. When the books first came out, I was in sixth grade, and now as I am a rising freshmen, I am anticipating for the thirteenth book. The books are extremely funny and guaranteed to make anyone laugh. </p1>

<h3><u>Genius Files</u></h3>

<br />

<p2> Genius Files is also one my most favorite series. Unfortunately, the series ended few years ago, but I still reread the books every now and them. The plot of the book was so unique and interesting. Also, there was tons of action and jokes were cracked often.</p2>
