<p1> My family consists of five members- me, my mom, my dad, my older sister, and my younger sister. My older sister is currently 20 years old and my younger sister is currently 10 years old. I like my family because we all look out for each other, no matter what. In addition, I like my family because we do a lot of fun things such as plan really fun trips, go on cool vacations, and go fishing</p1>
