<p1> I started rowing around 2 years ago and would say I have become quite decent at it. I decided to learn in because it's a very important life skill in terms of an emrergency. In addition, I like it because it's really good for muscle toning and keeps me fit.</p1>

<h3><u>Drawing</u></h3>

<p2> I would say I am pretty decent when it comes to drawing too. I try to draw as much as I can in my free time. Also, I can't sit still and do my work; I have to doodle. Thus, drawing is a really good was to get that urge out because it keeps me focused.</p2>
