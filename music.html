<h2><u>Rap</u></h2>

<p1> Rap is something I have really been into since I was twelve years old. The aggressive and strong music really gets adrenaline boosting through my veins and I utalize this before a big tennis match or presentation. My favorite rapper has to be Drake. Not only is he really good, but the lyrics he has are truly from the hear and he has a really good voice.</p1>

<h3><u>Calming</u></h3>

<p2> Ironically, I also like calming music. After a long day at school, especially on test days, I utilize listening to calm music to cool myself down from anxiety and stress. In addition, I often listen to calm music before I sleep because it promotes a better sleep from me and makes me fall asleep easier.</p2>
